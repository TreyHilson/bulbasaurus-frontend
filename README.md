## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

My idea is a resource for cool house plants. I came up with it brainstorming and going through things like pinterests for inpiration. I think that a lot of people enjoy the idea and practice of adding a piece of nature into their homes. Users would be people who want to begin keeping a log of plants of interest and costs. Perhaps some fun facts about the plan as well.
I also find in conversations about plants with other people I learn something new. That piece was important to me because I wanted certain users to feel like they had something to offer of value as well when adding to their resource.
